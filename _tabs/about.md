## Short Biography
Currently a junior undergraduate at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), I am specializing in Computer Science and Technology (Artificial Intelligence and Big Data).

I have been admitted to the Master of Science in Information Engineering program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) and am expected to enroll in September 2024.

In the spring of 2022, I was privileged to join the HCP lab at SYSU, guided by Keze Wang. 


## Research Interests
I'm interested in many areas and I'm always excited to take on something new. 

Recently, my research focuses on Computer Vision and Human-Computer Interaction. Most of my work now involves gesture generation based on diffusion models.

## Hobbies

I like to travel and take pictures. Even though I don't have professional photographic equipment, I still enjoy the process of finding beauty in the world around me.

At the same time, I'm a transportation fanatic and am very interested in all types of transportation (spacecrafts, airplanes, trains, metros, etc.).
