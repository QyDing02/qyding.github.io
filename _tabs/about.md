## Short Biography
Currently a junior undergraduate at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), I am specializing in Computer Science and Technology (Artificial Intelligence and Big Data).

In the spring of 2022, I was privileged to join the HCP lab, guided by Keze Wang. 


## Research Interests
I'm interested in many areas and I'm always excited to take on something new. 

Recently, my research focuses on Computer Vision and Human-Computer Interaction. Most of my work now involves gesture generation based on diffusion models.

## Hobbies

I like to travel and take pictures. Even though I don't have professional photographic equipment, I still enjoy the process of finding beauty in the world around me.

At the same time, I'm a transportation fanatic and am very interested in all types of transportation (spacecrafts, airplanes, high speed trains, etc.).
